# Overview

This is a bamboo plugin project which when installed enables configuration of rake build tasks.

# Goals

* Discover ruby installations managed by RVM and list them in bamboo.
* Discover ruby installations managed by the systems package manager.
* Perform a rake build based on selection of a ruby runtime and entry of some build targets.
* Parse the output of RSpec2 run and display a table of results.

# Usage

To use this plugin you will need a ruby runtime, this can either be the one installed by default on OSX or one installed
via package manager in for example ubuntu. If your build server is not running as root, which is preferable, you will need
to install all the gems used by your project prior to running a build.

# RVM Support

Alternatively you could install RVM from the link below, install all the gems used by your project, preferably
into it's own gem set.

As an example follow the following steps to setup a project and run some tests using this plugin. This assumes your using
either OSX or Linux. If your on OSX you will need to install XCode, and if your installing version 4.1 then you will
also need [GCC Installer](https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer/downloads) as this version omits gcc in favor
of llvm and clang.

1. Install RVM, once installed it will list some dependencies you will need to install if your on linux.

        bash < <(curl -s https://raw.github.com/wayneeseguin/rvm/master/binscripts/rvm-installer )

2. Install a ruby.


        rvm install 1.9.3


3. Switch to using this ruby.


        rvm use 1.9.3


4. Create a new gemset for rails.


        rvm gemset create rails3


5. Switch to this gemset.


        rvm use 1.9.3@rails3


6. Install the rails gem and rspec


        gem install rails rspec-rails


7. Build a new rails project

        rails bamboo-build-test -T

8. Add RSpec to project by appending this line to the bottom of the Gemfile in the newly created project.

        gem "rspec-rails", :group => [:test, :development]

9. Run bundler to ensure all the dependencies are installed into the gemset you created.

        bundle install

9. Configure rspec in this project.

        rails generate rspec:install

10. Using scaffold build a data entry interface for a model.

        rails generate scaffold Post name:string title:string content:text

11. Remove the two pending specs, not necessary for this example.

        rm ./spec/helpers/posts_helper_spec.r ./spec/models/post_spec.rb

12. Run the database migration script.

        rake db:migrate

13. Run rspec to ensure all the generated tests, should be all green.

        rspec spec

14. Add this project to your favourite online project hosting site.
15. Navigate to the capability admin interface and click the "Auto Detection" link, this should detect the installed
ruby and it's associated gemsets.
16. Create a plan which uses the online project site and add a job with a Rake Task which runs the spec target using the 1.9.3@rails3 runtime.

# Test Report

To enable test reporting do as follows.

1. Add the this fragment to your Gemfile.

        group :test do
            gem "rspec_junit_formatter"
        done

2. Edit your the .rspec file in the base of your project and replace the contents with.

        --format RspecJunitFormatter
        --out rspec.xml

3. Add a JUnit test task to your Job and configure it to look for rspec.xml which contains the test results.

# Bundler Features

In version 1.3 I added some bundler related features, these are:

1. Added an option to the Rake task to enable bundle exec when running the rake command.

2. Bundler task has been added which runs bundle install to dependencies during the build process. Note will only work when RVM is installed in the home directory of the user the build server is running under.

# Ruby Runtime Manager Support

In version 1.5 I added support for more than one ruby version manager. The ones which were initially supported are:

* System Ruby Runtime Manager which is a very primitive discovery routine which search /usr/bin and /usr/local/bin for ruby and gem commands. Note it is done this way to avoid PATH overrides in the default shell, commonly done by developers or RVM.
* RVM Runtime Manager which as before supports RVM installed rubies.

To enable this feature a concept of runtime labels was introduced, these are in the form of ruby runtime manager then ruby version and gemset (for those without gemsets everything it is set to default) for example 'RVM 1.9.3-p0@rails32'.

When the plugin encounters a runtime label which has no ruby runtime manager as with existing installations it will just use RVM.
